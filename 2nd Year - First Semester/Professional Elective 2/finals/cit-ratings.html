        <p class='description'>The ambiance is great and peaceful to learn new things. The professors and instructors are dedicated to their jobs and excellent in nurturing students to be ready in professional career. They have enough computers, all computer laboratories are air conditioned but not the lecture rooms, the library was enough for learning and there are places to rest and socialize.</p>

        <p class='description'>There was a sense of glamour and pride in being in this college. I spend a lot of good times in and out of the campus in college but I would never forget the various experiences and realizations I had while I was in this school. It helped mold me to be more persevering in my aspirations and goals as a person.</p>

        <p class='description'>Since my school was quite far from my house, I consider it immediately as my second home literally. I did not want to be late from my classes so I ate all my meals in there. Because I could not go home if I have 3- hour break, then I took my naps in there too. Good thing my school has a big, cold library, which was my sanctuary throughout those years.</p>

        <p class='description'>Picturing the whole school, I should say that the students are diversified. Some students are not so serious about their studies and opt on playing games outside the campus, others are just normal students who perform on a case-to-case basis depending on factors they qualify for themselves, while a not-so-large portion of the population perform very well and are very competitive like me.</p>

        <p class='description'>Our professors were really supportive, not only with our academics but also with helping mother nature.We were given enough equipment and provided well ventilated facilities which made it conducive for learning.</p>

        <p class='description'>The school will help you a lot especially if you also help yourself. However, the school is only limited to extending HELP, it is you who will do the heavy lifting! It's a good training actually.</p>
