        <p class='description'> The professors/teachers, they were really are our second parents. They really did their best to deliver the topics or messages they wanted to convey to us even though their personal needs were not attained. They not just treated us for the sake of grades but also in molding our attitudes and values... the attitudes and values "must have" of a caring with knowledge and compassionate nurse.</p>

        <p class='description'>Cool atmosphere & calibrated professors. It needs more improvement on facilities but the good thing was both students and faculties were able to utilize all available resources to produce quality education.</p>

        <p class='description'>Initially, it surprised me how much more casual the student - faculty relationships were in the university. It had me feeling slightly uncomfortable at first because I had never regarded my teachers as 'friends' or 'buddies' outside the classroom - but I later on learned how much this more relaxed type of relationship helped me. Also, by being more open with our teachers, we were able to learn about their experiences related to the course and take some of their advice, which usually turn out to be very helpful.</p>

        <p class='description'>I chose this school because based on it's track record, it produces a lot of topnotchers and for four consecutive years (Since 2010), yielded a 100% passing rate in the local Philippine Nurse's Licensure Exam. To top it all off, the school has one of the cheapest tuition fees. CNU also is affiliated with the largest government hospital in the Vis-Min region which is Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) which makes your training as a student nurse wider and a lot more hands-on.</p>

        <p class='description'>This is very intersting school in a way that we have to take the entrance exam and we have to pass it. There will be interview which you have to show your talents in speaking and acting. The school is very strict in this because we are called "Government Scholars" as they say. To be in this school we have to develop mostly the skills mentioned above. Facilities, they are improving on this each year.</p>

        <p class='description'>The professors, we call them as "tormentors" because they are the REASON why we are having sleepless nights almost all the time. They give us loads and loads of requirements that have to be passed the next day and oh, they give quizzes UNANNOUNCED so you have to do a lot of advanced reading. Despite of being "tormentors", our professors always monitor us and inform us of our deficits and give us chances to catch up.</p>
