        <p class='description'>I fell in love with the campus. Though it is in the middle of Cebu City, structure and facilities, and down-to-earth students were very conducive to learningâ€”especially the professors who are reliable and competent. I felt that people were there to learn as and I didn't feel judged pressured to fit into a mold. USC became my home.</p>
